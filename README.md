# Data-professional-Survey-Breakdown

In this guided project, I utilized a dataset from a survey of data professionals to gain insights into career transitions within the data profession from diverse backgrounds.

The steps involved in the analysis:

1. Data Extraction: Importing the input file into Power Bi tool.
2. Data Cleaning: Removing uneccesary columns and duplicate values.
3. Data Manipulation: Creating a new measure as Average Salary.
4. Data Visualization: Building an interactive dashboard to get insights on the data professionals survey.
 
Insights derived from the dashboard:

1. The most lucrative professions are those of data scientists and data engineers.
2. Python is the favored programming language among data professionals, with data analysts utilizing it the most.
3. Average income of female professionals is higher than male professionals.
4. Most data professionals are not satisfied with their salaries and work/life balance.
5. Majority of data professionals find transitioning into a data career neither easy nor difficult.
